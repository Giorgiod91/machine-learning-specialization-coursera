# Machine Learning Specialization by Coursera Andrew Ng 
I'm currently enrolled in the [Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction#outcomes), which covers a range of foundational machine learning topics.
noting things i learn here.


- supervised Learning ---> gives the learning algorithm examples to learn on with correct answers   -->  input x to output y
  - types = Regression leanrs to predict number out of infinite possible numbers
          = Classification predict categories dont have to be numbers for example pictures small limited set of possible output categories like 0 and 1 and so on


    - Regression Models: Linear regression = has right answers 
    classification models predicting categories small number of possible output 

- unsupervised Learning ---> finding structures Clustering groups categories without giving any output y only with the input x

-training set ==>  (x(i), y(i))= i th the (i) is the index nothing else in the training set contains features and targets 

Linear regression
f w,b(x) = wx + b
f(x) = wx + b short form
Univariate = 1 variable
