# Machine Learning Specialization by Coursera
I'm currently enrolled in the [Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction#outcomes), which covers a range of foundational machine learning topics.


- supervised Learning ---> gives the learning algorithm examples to learn on with correct answers   -->  input x to output y
  - types = Regression leanrs to predict number out of infinite possible numbers
          = Classification predict categories dont have to be numbers for example pictures small limited set of possible output categories like 0 and 1 and so on
